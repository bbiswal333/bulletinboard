Exercise 23: Setup Generic Authorization
========================================

## Learning Goal
After this exercise you will know how to define an authorization model for your application and how to configure generic authorizations for any endpoint (path) of your application without any code changes.

The task of this exercise is to declare a "start authorization" for the security descriptor of your application and reference it from the configuration file of the approuter, so that the approuter is able to perform a generic authorization check on the declared start authorization.

## Prerequisite
Continue with your solution of the last exercise. If this does not work, you can checkout the branch [`origin/solution-22-Deploy-AppRouter`](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/cc-java/cc-bulletinboard-ads-spring-webmvc/tree/solution-22-Deploy-AppRouter).<sub><b>[to-do]</b></sub>

## Step 1: Define Scopes and Role Templates

Before we can enable generic authorization checks we need to define so-called **"application scopes"** in order to define functional authorizations such as "Display", "Update" and "Delete".

And we also have to define **"role templates"** that specify which role has what scopes. Later, users are assigned to roles and thereby get the specified scopes as authorization keys. 

##### Create the security descriptor file `xs-security.json`

To declare the **Role Templates**, create the security descriptor file `xs-security.json` either in the root folder or in a `security` sub-folder. Include the following authorization model of your application:

```json
{
    "xsappname"     : "bulletinboard-d012345",
    "description"   : "Enabled bulletinboard for multi tenants",
    "tenant-mode"   : "shared",
    "scopes"        : [
                        {
                          "name"                 : "$XSAPPNAME.Display",
                          "description"          : "Display advertisements"
                        },
                        {
                          "name"                 : "$XSAPPNAME.Update",
                          "description"          : "Update advertisements"
                        }
                      ],
    "role-templates": [
                        {
                          "name"                 : "Viewer",
                          "description"          : "View advertisements",
                          "scope-references"     : [
                                                        "$XSAPPNAME.Display"             
                                                   ]                                            
                        },
                        {
                          "name"                 : "Advertiser",
                          "description"          : "Maintain advertisements",
                          "scope-references"     : [
                                                        "$XSAPPNAME.Display",             
                                                        "$XSAPPNAME.Update"             
                                                   ]                                            
                        }
    ]
}
```

Notes: 
* The value of `xsappname` must be unique within the whole Cloud Foundry Org. Therefore, don't forget to **use your d/c/i-user in the xsappname** to refer to your unique instance!
* The `shared tenant-mode` leads the XSUAA service instance to trust other tenants that are different to the one that corresponds to the cf org such as `d012345trial`.
* We have now defined a generic scope for starting the application. Typically, every authorization model of an application contains application/domain specific scopes ([see next exercise](Exercise_24_MakeYourApplicationSecure.md)).

## Step 2: Configure start conditions for routes / endpoints

In order to define the **Start Condition** we need to configure our route(s) with the required scope definition: In the approuter configuration file `.src/main/approuter/xs-app.json` we add an additional line that references the **scope** previously defined in `./security/xs-security.json`:

```
{
    "welcomeFile": "index.html",
    "routes": [{
        "source": "^/ads/api/",
        "target": "/api/",
        "destination": "ads-destination",
        "scope": "$XSAPPNAME.Display"
      }, {
        "source": "^/ads",
        "target": "/",
        "destination": "ads-destination"
    }]
}
```

## Step 3: Deploy the (updated) application security descriptor to XSA UAA

With the following command you can update the existing XS UAA service instance, which needs to know the authorization model of your application (`bulletinboard-d012345`).
```bash
# Ensure that you are in the project root e.g. ~/git/cc-bulletinboard-ads
$    cf update-service uaa-bulletinboard -c security/xs-security.json
```


## Step 4: Push and test the service

Push your application to Cloud Foundry:
```
$    cf push
```

Then enter the approuter URL e.g. `https://d012345trial-approuter-d012345.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/ads/api/v1/ads` in the browser. Make sure that it responds with message "Forbidden" (HTTP Status code `403`).
